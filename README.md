Breast Cancer Classification Using Neural network
## Overview

This project aims to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using neural network models. Breast cancer classification is a crucial task in medical diagnostics, and machine learning techniques, particularly neural networks, can assist in automating this process with high accuracy.

## Background

Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer among women worldwide. Early detection and accurate diagnosis play a crucial role in successful treatment. Machine learning, particularly neural networks, offers promising approaches to automate the classification of breast cancer tumors based on various features extracted from medical images or other diagnostic tests.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is  breast cancer dataset available from sklearn library itself. This dataset contains many features for identifying benign or malignant such as mean radius, mean texture , mean perimeter , mean area, mean smoothness ,  mean compactness , mean concavity , mean concave point , mean symmetry , mean fractal dimension , radius error ,  texture error ,  perimeter error , area error , smoothness error ,  compactness error ,  concavity error , concave points error ,  symmetry error , fractal dimension error ,  worst radius ,  worst texture , worst perimeter ,  worst area ,  worst smoothness , worst compactness ,  worst concavity ,  worst concave points , worst symmetry ,  worst fractal dimension   and the task is to classify tumors as either malignant or benign.

## Neural Network Architecture

The neural network architecture used for breast cancer classification typically involves input layers, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The input layer accepts the features  from breast cancer dataset. The hidden layers perform feature extraction and representation learning, while the output layer predicts the likelihood of the tumor being malignant or benign.
